# pypsr

Windows' [Problem Steps Recorder](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-use-Problem-Steps-Recorder)
(or `psr.exe`) generates a report containing all steps a user performed, 
including screenshots of those steps, in a single file.

Pypsr parses such a file generated by `psr` and places the resources contained 
within the file into a single directory.

## Installation

For now, just copy the `psr.py` file to your hard drive. You might want to make
it executable:

    chmod +x psr.py

If you're on OSX, you can download the `Psr.app` application in the `osx` 
folder.

## Usage

This will parse the `mht` file in the zip and create a directory called 
`bugreport.exploded`. Open up the `main.htm` in that directory to view the 
report.

    psr.py bugreport.zip


You can of course pass the `mht` file directly. The generated directory will 
be called `Problem_20120623_1342.exploded`:

    psr.py Problem_20120623_1342.mht

You can specify a directory to use:

    psr.py bugreport.zip ~/Desktop/bugreport

And you can tell pypsr to open up the report in your browser automatically:

    psr.py bugreport.zip -b
